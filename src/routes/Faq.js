      <h2> How does the FreeAid game work?</h2>
      <p>
        As you play through the interactive game, unobtrusive advertisements are
        shown next to the game interface. As these ads render, a small ad
        payment is made to FreeAid which is then donated to BLM and social
        justice related charities. These payments are accumulated through Aid
        Points, which are an outward-facing metric representing the amount of
        money you have earned by playing the game for charity.
      </p>

      <h2>Which Charities does FreeAid support?</h2>

      <p>
        FreeAid is constantly updating the list of charities that we donate to.
        Our main recipients come from Charity Navigator's [list of highly-rated
        Civil Rights
        charities](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=5204),
        ranked for their financial health and transparency in operations.{" "}
      </p>

      <h2>Where do the ads come from?</h2>

      <p>
        FreeAid does not endorse any company, product or service, including any
        represented by any advertisement you may see while navigating the web
        platform. Advertisements on Freerice come via the Google Adsense
        platform. Advertisers do not enter into any contractual relationship or
        partnership with FreeAid. FreeAid has an extensive list of banned
        industries and advertisers, so no inappropriate advertisements should
        ever appear on the site or in the apps. However, if you come upon an
        advertisement that you deem inappropriate, please contact us at
        freeaidorg[@g](mailto:WFP.Freerice@wfp.org)mail.com.{" "}
      </p>

      <h2>What if I am not seeing any advertisements?</h2>

      <p>
        If you are using ad blocking software, please check that you whitelist
        [FreeAid.org](http://freeaid.org) or temporarily disable your ad
        blocker.{" "}
      </p>

      <h2>How is the question content curated?</h2>

      <p>
        We have a team of volunteers that help to contribute content for the
        interactive game. Each question is made up of a "content block" which
        includes the multiple choice question, the post-answer blurb, and the
        embedded Wikipedia link in the "learn more" link. This configuration was
        created to allow users to engage with longer-form, more nuanced content
        while providing a low barrier of entry for education. If you are
        interested in volunteering to create content, please email us at
        freeaidorg@gmail.com.
      </p>

      <h2>What if I want to volunteer?</h2>
      <p>
        We are always looking for help, whether to develop content or work on
        our tech stack. Please fill out the [Form
        here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddfLljFLxKXXFcr9jS5llXBsrdgQYXI6l00x6C1qUWMVJWdQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
