Board of Education of Topeka, was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that U.S. state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional, even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality. Handed down on May 17, 1954, the Court\'s unanimous (9\u20130) decision stated that "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal," and therefore violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, the decision\'s 14 pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools, and the Court\'s second decision in Brown II in 1955 only ordered states to desegregate "with all deliberate speed."',wikiLink:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education"},{question:"What was the outcome of the murder trial of Emmet Till?",answers:[{content:"The two defends were acquitted by an all white jury",type:!0},{content:"The two defendents were given life in prison",type:!1},{content:"The two defendents were given the death sentence",type:!1}],postAnswer:"In September 1955, an all-white jury found Bryant and Milam not guilty of Till's kidnapping and murder.

Parks soon became the symbol of the resulting Montgomery Bus Boycott and received national publicity.

Voter Education Project (VEP) raised and distributed foundation funds to civil rights organizations for voter education and registration work in the southern United States from 1962 to 1992.

More than six hundred marched out of the church fifty at a time in an attempt to walk to City Hall to speak to Birmingham's mayor about segregation. They were arrested and put into jail. On the next day, however, another one thousand students gathered at the church. When Bevel started them marching fifty at a time, Bull Connor finally unleashed police dogs on them and then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children.

The marches were organized by nonviolent activists to demonstrate the desire of African-American citizens to exercise their constitutional right to vote, in defiance of segregationist repression; they were part of a broader voting rights movement underway in Selma and throughout the American South. By highlighting racial injustice, stemming from the murder of activist and deacon Jimmie Lee Jackson  by state trooper James Bonard Fowler, they contributed to passage that year of the Voting Rights Act, a landmark federal achievement of the civil rights movement.",wikiLink:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma_to_Montgomery_marches"}];var c=function(e){return
