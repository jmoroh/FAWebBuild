Center and Museum, in Greensboro, North Carolina, which led to the F. W.

Board of Education\",\"type\":true},{\"content\":\"Plessy v. Ferguson\",\"type\":false},{\"content\":\"Dred Scott v. Sandford\",\"type\":false}],\"postAnswer\":\"Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that U.S. state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional, even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality. Handed down on May 17, 1954, the Court's unanimous (9–0) decision stated that \\\"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal,\\\" and therefore violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, the decision's 14 pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools, and the Court's second decision in Brown II in 1955 only ordered states to desegregate \\\"with all deliberate speed.\\\"\",\"wikiLink\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education\"},{\"question\":\"What was the outcome of the murder trial of Emmet Till?\",\"answers\":[{\"content\":\"The two defends were acquitted by an all white jury\",\"type\":true},{\"content\":\"The two defendents were given life in prison\",\"type\":false},{\"content\":\"The two defendents were given the death sentence\",\"type\":false}],\"postAnswer\":\"In September 1955, an all-white jury found Bryant and Milam not guilty of Till's kidnapping and murder.

Voter Education Project (VEP) raised and distributed foundation funds to civil rights organizations for voter education and registration work in the southern United States from 1962 to 1992. The project was federally endorsed by the Kennedy administration in hopes that the organizations of the ongoing Civil Rights Movement would shift their focus away from demonstrations and more towards the support of voter registration.\",\"wikiLink\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_Education_Project\"},{\"question\":\"After applying and being rejected from Mississippi Southern College, this Black Korean War-veteran published a series of letters about the need for desegregation and was imprisoned by the state of Mississippi on false charges\",\"answers\":[{\"content\":\"Clyde Kennard\",\"type\":true},{\"content\":\"Dick Gregory\",\"type\":false},{\"content\":\"Medgar Evers\",\"type\":false}],\"postAnswer\":\"In the 1950s, Clyde Kennard attempted several times to enroll at the all-white Mississippi Southern College (now the University of Southern Mississippi) to complete his undergraduate degree started at the University of Chicago.

When Bevel started them marching fifty at a time, Bull Connor finally unleashed police dogs on them and then turned the city's fire hoses water streams on the children.
